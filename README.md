# My Blockchain (5470)

A custom blockchain implementation in Python, designed as a full node with support for proof-of-work (PoW), peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, and transaction validation using a TensorFlow-based autoencoder.

## Description

This project implements a blockchain with the following key features:
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Blocks are mined by solving a computational problem with a fixed difficulty (4 leading zeros in the hash).
- **P2P Network**: Nodes connect to each other to synchronize the chain and propagate blocks and transactions.
- **Transaction Validation**: A TensorFlow autoencoder detects anomalies in transactions.
- **Persistence in PostgreSQL**: The chain and balances are stored in a database to maintain state.
- **HTTP API**: Allows querying the full chain at `http://localhost:5000/chain`.

The project includes cryptography with RSA and ECDSA (SECP256k1) keys for signing transactions, a mining reward system with halving, and transaction fees.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL** (with a database named `blockchain` and the required tables)
- **Python Dependencies** (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/547atoshinakamo70/547-blockchain
   cd 547-blockchain
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
Install dependencies:
Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:
ecdsa
cryptography
psycopg2-binary
tensorflow
numpy
python-dotenv
Then run:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure PostgreSQL:
Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
Create the blockchain database:
sql
CREATE DATABASE blockchain;
Create the necessary tables:
sql
CREATE TABLE blockchain (index SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, data JSONB);
CREATE TABLE balances (address TEXT PRIMARY KEY, balance BIGINT);
Configure the .env file:
Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
FERNET_KEY=your_optional_fernet_key
If you donâ€™t provide a FERNET_KEY, one will be generated automatically when the node starts.
Usage
Run the node:
bash
python3 My_blockchain.py
The node starts a P2P server on localhost:6000.
The HTTP server runs on localhost:5000.
It begins mining blocks every 10 seconds (configurable via BLOCK_TIME).
Connect to other nodes:
Edit the code to connect to another node, for example:
python
blockchain.network.connect_to_peer("localhost", 6001)
Ensure the other node is running and accessible.
Query the chain:
Open a browser or use curl to view the chain in JSON format:
bash
curl http://localhost:5000/chain
Key Features
PoW Mining: Each block requires a hash starting with 4 zeros, adjusted by a nonce.
P2P Network: Nodes synchronize the chain and share new blocks and transactions.
AI Validation: An autoencoder verifies transactions based on features like addresses, amount, and timestamp.
Cryptography: Uses RSA for owner keys and ECDSA for signing/verifying transactions.
Rewards and Fees: Miners receive a reward (initially 50, halving every 210,000 blocks) and a 0.2% transaction fee.
Example Usage
Create and sign a transaction:
python
# Generate keys
private_key, public_key = generate_key_pair()
tx = Transaction(public_key, blockchain.owner_public_key, 10)
tx.sign(private_key[2:-1])  # Remove PEM prefixes/suffixes for ECDSA
if blockchain.is_valid_transaction(tx):
    blockchain.pending_transactions.append(tx)
    blockchain.network.broadcast({"type": "NEW_TX", "data": tx.to_dict()})
Manually mine a block:
python
blockchain.mine_block()
Important Notes
Database: Ensure PostgreSQL is configured and the tables exist before running the node.
P2P Network: Nodes must be on the same network or have public IPs to connect.
Dependencies: Make sure to install all libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Autoencoder: The model is initially trained with random data; for real use, train it with valid transactions.
