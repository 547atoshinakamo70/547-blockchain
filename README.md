Below is a professional guide translated into English, detailing how to run the provided code on an Ubuntu system from scratch to full execution. The Python script implements a blockchain with advanced features such as zero-knowledge proofs, an HTTP server, PostgreSQL database interaction, RabbitMQ messaging, and a TensorFlow AI model. This guide covers environment setup, dependency installation, and code execution with verification steps.
Professional Guide: Running the Code on Ubuntu from 0 to 100
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
A machine running Ubuntu (version 20.04 or higher recommended).
Terminal access with administrator privileges (sudo).
An internet connection to download dependencies.
Step 1: Install System Dependencies
The code requires several tools and services on the operating system. Install them step-by-step.
1.1 Update the System
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
1.2 Install Python 3 and pip
The script uses Python 3, so install Python and its package manager, pip:
bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
Verify the installed versions:
bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
1.3 Install PostgreSQL
The script interacts with a PostgreSQL database:
bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib -y
Start the PostgreSQL service:
bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
1.4 Install RabbitMQ
The script uses pika for messaging, which requires RabbitMQ:
bash
sudo apt install rabbitmq-server -y
Start the RabbitMQ service:
bash
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
Step 2: Configure the PostgreSQL Database
The script expects a database named blockchain and a postgres user with a defined password.
2.1 Access the postgres User
bash
sudo -i -u postgres
2.2 Create the Database
In the PostgreSQL console:
sql
psql
CREATE DATABASE blockchain;
2.3 Set the postgres User Password
Set a password (e.g., password):
sql
ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'password';
2.4 Create Required Tables
The script uses two tables: blockchain for blocks and balances for account balances. Create them:
sql
\c blockchain
CREATE TABLE blockchain (
    index SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data JSONB NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE balances (
    address VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    balance BIGINT NOT NULL
);
Exit PostgreSQL:
sql
\q
exit
Step 3: Install Python Libraries
The script depends on several Python libraries not included in the standard library. Install them with pip3:
bash
pip3 install ecdsa cryptography psycopg2-binary pika tensorflow numpy python-dotenv requests
Explanation of Libraries:
ecdsa: For digital signatures.
cryptography: For Fernet encryption and RSA key generation.
psycopg2-binary: PostgreSQL database connection.
pika: RabbitMQ messaging.
tensorflow: AI model implementation.
numpy: Numerical computations.
python-dotenv: Load environment variables from a .env file.
requests: HTTP requests for block broadcasting.
Step 4: Create the .env File
The script loads environment variables from a .env file. Create this file in the same directory as the script.
4.1 Generate a Fernet Key
Run this Python command to generate a Fernet key:
bash
python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
Copy the generated key (e.g., your_fernet_key_here).
4.2 Create the .env File
Create the file with the following content (adjust values as needed):
DATABASE_URL=dbname=blockchain user=postgres password=password host=localhost
KYC_API_URL=https://example.com/verify
FERNET_KEY=your_fernet_key_here
DB_PASSWORD=password
Save the file as .env in the script’s directory.
Step 5: Set Up the zk_proof_verifier Executable
The script calls an external executable named zk_proof_verifier to verify zero-knowledge proofs. Since this program isn’t provided, create a dummy script.
5.1 Create a Dummy Script
Create a file named zk_proof_verifier:
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "valid"
5.2 Grant Execution Permissions
bash
chmod +x zk_proof_verifier
5.3 Place It in the PATH or Current Directory
Move it to /usr/local/bin/ for global access:
bash
sudo mv zk_proof_verifier /usr/local/bin/
Alternatively, keep it in the same directory as the script.
Step 6: Save and Run the Script
6.1 Save the Code
Copy the provided code into a file, e.g., blockchain.py, and save it in your working directory.
6.2 Run the Script
Execute the script with Python 3:
bash
python3 blockchain.py
The script will:
Generate a key pair for the blockchain owner and print it in the terminal (store the private key securely).
Start an HTTP server on port 5000.
Enter an infinite loop to keep the server running.
Step 7: Verify Functionality
7.1 Check the Server
Open another terminal and verify the server responds:
bash
curl http://localhost:5000/chain
You should see a JSON response with the blockchain, initially containing only the genesis block.
7.2 Test Additional Endpoints
Get pending transactions:
bash
curl http://localhost:5000/pending_transactions
Get peers:
bash
curl http://localhost:5000/peers
Check the balance of an address (use the owner’s public key printed at startup):
bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/balance?address=<public_key>"
Additional Considerations
Security
Private Key: Do not share the blockchain owner’s private key generated at startup.
Passwords: Use strong passwords in production and avoid plaintext in the .env file.
KYC_API_URL: The example uses a dummy URL (https://example.com/verify). For real implementation, configure a valid identity verification API.
Scalability
PostgreSQL: The connection pool is set to a maximum of 50. Ensure PostgreSQL supports this (max_connections in postgresql.conf):
bash
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf
Change max_connections to 100 or higher, then restart:
bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
AI Model
The TensorFlow model is defined but untrained. To train it, implement logic in the train_hidden_model function with real transaction data.
P2P Network
Peers must be added manually via the /register_peer API. Example:
bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"peer": "http://other_node:5000"}' http://localhost:5000/register_peer
Summary of Steps
Install system dependencies: Python 3, pip, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ.
Configure PostgreSQL: Create the blockchain database and required tables.
Install Python libraries: Use pip3 to install dependencies.
Create the .env file: Set up environment variables.
Set up zk_proof_verifier: Create a dummy script or use the real one if available.
Run the script: Execute python3 blockchain.py.
Verify: Test endpoints with curl or a browser.
With these steps, the code should be fully operational on your Ubuntu machine! If issues arise, check blockchain.log or terminal output for debugging. Let me know if you need further assistance!
