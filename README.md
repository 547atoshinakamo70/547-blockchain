Here’s a comprehensive guide in English to help you run the provided blockchain code and mine the cryptocurrency "5470" (symbol: "547"). This guide assumes you have basic technical knowledge, such as familiarity with command-line tools and Python. Follow these steps carefully to set up the environment, execute the code, and start mining.
Guide to Running the Blockchain Code and Mining the Cryptocurrency
This guide will walk you through setting up and running a blockchain system written in Python, which includes features like block creation, transaction validation using AI, zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs), and an HTTP server for interaction. By the end, you’ll be able to run the blockchain and mine new blocks to earn "547" tokens.
Introduction
The provided code implements a blockchain for the "5470" cryptocurrency with a total supply of 5,470,000 tokens, mined gradually. It uses PostgreSQL for storage, TensorFlow for AI-based transaction validation, and an HTTP server for network interaction. Mining involves proposing valid blocks to the chain, earning a reward that halves every 210,000 blocks, starting at 50 tokens per block.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
Hardware: A computer with at least 4GB RAM and sufficient disk space for PostgreSQL.
Software:
Python 3.8 or higher (download from python.org).
PostgreSQL (download from postgresql.org).
Git (optional, for cloning repositories).
Step 1: Install Dependencies
The code relies on several Python libraries. Install them using pip:
bash
pip install ecdsa cryptography psycopg2-binary pika tensorflow numpy python-dotenv requests
Notes:
TensorFlow: Installation may vary by operating system. Follow the TensorFlow installation guide if you encounter issues (e.g., you might need specific versions or GPU support).
psycopg2-binary: This connects Python to PostgreSQL. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed first (see Step 2).
Step 2: Set Up the Database
The blockchain stores its chain and balances in a PostgreSQL database. Here’s how to configure it:
Install PostgreSQL:
Follow the instructions for your OS at postgresql.org/download.
Create the Database:
Open a terminal and log into PostgreSQL:
bash
psql -U postgres
Create the database:
sql
CREATE DATABASE blockchain;
(Optional) Create a user and set a password:
sql
CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE blockchain TO myuser;
Exit with \q.
Initialize Tables:
The code expects two tables: blockchain (for blocks) and balances (for account balances). Run these SQL commands in psql:
sql
\c blockchain
CREATE TABLE blockchain (
    index INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    data TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE balances (
    address TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    balance BIGINT NOT NULL
);
Step 3: Create the .env File
The code uses environment variables loaded from a .env file. Create this file in the same directory as your script (e.g., blockchain.py) with the following content:
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
FERNET_KEY=your_fernet_key_here
KYC_API_URL=https://example.com/verify  # Optional
DB_PASSWORD: Replace mypassword with your PostgreSQL user’s password.
FERNET_KEY: Generate a key for encryption using this Python snippet:
python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())
Copy the output into the .env file.
KYC_API_URL: Optional. Leave it as is or remove it if not using a KYC service.
Step 4: Configure zk_proof_verifier
The code calls an external executable zk_proof_verifier for zero-knowledge proofs. Since it’s not provided, simulate it for testing:
Create a Dummy Executable:
On Linux/Mac, create a file named zk_proof_verifier:
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "valid"
Make it executable:
bash
chmod +x zk_proof_verifier
Place it in the same directory as your script.
Windows Alternative:
Create a file named zk_proof_verifier.bat:
bat
@echo valid
Ensure it’s in the script’s directory.
Note: For a real deployment, replace this with a proper zk-proof verification tool.
Step 5: Run the Main Script
Save the Code:
Copy the provided code into a file named blockchain.py.
Execute the Script:
Open a terminal in the script’s directory and run:
bash
python3 blockchain.py
This starts the blockchain and an HTTP server on port 5000. You’ll see logs indicating the server is running.
Expected Output:
The script creates a genesis block if the database is empty and prints the owner’s private and public keys. Save the private key securely—it’s needed for signing transactions.
Step 6: Mining Blocks
The code doesn’t include an automated miner, so you’ll propose blocks manually via the HTTP API to mine "547" tokens. Here’s how:
Understand Block Rewards:
The initial reward is 50 tokens, halving every 210,000 blocks.
You earn the reward by proposing a valid block containing a reward transaction from "system" to your address.
Get Your Public Key:
When you first run the script, it prints the owner’s public key (e.g., a PEM-formatted RSA key). This is your address for receiving rewards.
Propose a Block:
Use a tool like curl or Postman to send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/propose_block.
Example payload for the first block after genesis (index 1):
json
{
  "index": 1,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "from": "system",
      "to": "your_public_key_here",
      "amount": 50,
      "timestamp": 1698771234.0,
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": 1698771234.0,
  "previous_hash": "0",
  "nonce": 0
}
Replace "your_public_key_here" with your public key from Step 5.
Update timestamp to the current time (e.g., run time.time() in Python).
"previous_hash": "0" is correct for the first block after genesis. For subsequent blocks, use the hash of the last block (accessible via GET /chain).
Send the Request:
Using curl:
bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"index": 1, "transactions": [{"from": "system", "to": "your_public_key_here", "amount": 50, "timestamp": 1698771234.0, "metadata": {}}], "timestamp": 1698771234.0, "previous_hash": "0", "nonce": 0}' http://localhost:5000/propose_block
A 201 response ({"message": "Block added successfully"}) means the block was mined, and your balance increased by 50 tokens.
Check Your Balance:
Query your balance with:
bash
curl http://localhost:5000/balance?address=your_public_key_here
Repeat:
Increment index, update previous_hash to the new block’s hash, and adjust timestamp. Only one "system" transaction (reward) is allowed per block.
Security Considerations
Private Key Safety: Store your private key securely (e.g., in an encrypted file). Never share it—it controls your funds.
Database Security: Use a strong PostgreSQL password and restrict access (e.g., update pg_hba.conf).
Network Security: For public use, secure the HTTP server with HTTPS and authentication.
Troubleshooting
Database Errors:
Check DB_PASSWORD in .env matches your PostgreSQL setup.
Ensure PostgreSQL is running (sudo service postgresql start on Linux).
ModuleNotFoundError:
Verify all libraries are installed (pip list).
Block Rejection:
Ensure previous_hash matches the last block’s hash.
Only one "system" transaction per block is allowed.
Port Conflict:
If port 5000 is in use, edit run_server(port=5000) in the code to another port (e.g., 5001).
Next Steps
Automate Mining: Write a script to propose blocks periodically, fetching the latest chain state from /chain.
Join a Network: Register peers via POST /register_peer to sync with others.
Enhance AI Model: Train nn_model with real transaction data for better validation.
By following this guide, you can run the blockchain and mine "547" tokens. Happy mining! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
